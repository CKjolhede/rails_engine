# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#

# This code is how to utilize factory_bot to create seed data (not part of this project)
# require 'factory_bot_rails'
# 10.times do
#   FactoryBot.create :book
# end


# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
